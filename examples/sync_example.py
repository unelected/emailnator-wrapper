Example usage of the synchronous EmailGenerator.

This script demonstrates how to:
    1. Initialize the synchronous `EmailGenerator`.
    2. Generate a new temporary email address.
    3. Retrieve messages associated with the generated email.
    4. Print the generated email and its messages.

Typical output:
    Generated: example.email@domain.com
    Messages: ['Welcome to service!', 'Your verification code is 123456']
